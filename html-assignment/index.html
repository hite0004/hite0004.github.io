            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am Hitesh from India, and I moved here to Canada to attend Algonquin College for my higher education. I'm enrolled in a two-year diploma programme for <strong>Interactive Media Design</strong>. I completed my 12<sup>th</sup> (high school) from St. Thomas School and made the decision to go abroad to continue my education.
            </p>
            <p>
                If I were to talk about my future plans and interests, I would say that after graduating from <abbr title="Algonquin College">AC</abbr> , I plan to pursue a career as a <em>videographer</em> or <em>cinematographer</em>. I have had an interest in this industry since I was a teenager. And about my hobbies I enjoy travelling, watching films and television shows, and taking photos.
